Accessing Data workshop

## Welcome to the Accessing Data workshop!

The aim of this workshop is to access different pieces of data from a JSON object and return their values.
This is an essential skill, one example of it in use is when interacting with different APIs to display
data in the front end of an application.

## GETTING STARTED

To make life simpler all of the functions have already been created for you in the index.js file. As has your JSON data which
can be found in the data folder under superheroes.json. In addition to this the object has been imported for you into the
index.js file and saved under the label superheroes

As you work through the tasks you should use npm test to check whether or not you have returned the correct values
from each function.

- Tip: if you want to isolate just the function you are working on, add .only to the relevant test in the test file

## Tasks

Work through each of the following tasks to find the relevant data:

TASK 1 - getSquadName

- use the getSquadName function and return the name of the superhero squad from the superheroes object

Task 2 - getMemberNames

- use the getMemberNames function and return an array containing the name of each member in the squad

Task 3 - getMoleculeManHeight

- use the getMoleculeManHeight function and return an object with the label height and Molecule Man's height

Task 4 - getMadameUpperCutAge

- use the getMadameUpperCutAge function and return Madame Uppercuts age

Task 5 - getEternalFlamePowers

- use the getEternalFlamePowers function to return an array of Eternal Flames powers

## Extension Task

- If you have used bracket annotation ([0], [1], [2]) to access the individual pieces of data in Task 3, 4 and 5, try and find the answer
  and assume that you do not know what position they are at in the data
